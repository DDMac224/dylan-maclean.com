## [Orbi Hacking](orbi-hacking)
I have been watching some hardware hacking videos on YouTube recently and wanted to try for myself. I found an old pair of Orbis one is a router and another is a satellite. Neither of which were in use, they also hadn't been updated in a while which made them perfect to try hardware hacking for the first time. My main goal was to dump the firmware and look through it at a later date.
