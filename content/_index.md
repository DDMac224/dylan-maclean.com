# About

Welcome to my website! I am a college student studying cyber security, I'm interested in offensive and defensive security, programming, machine learning, and photography. This is where I will document my projects and post my photos. This website was built with Hugo and is self hosted, I will share the source code on my GitHub. If you have any questions, reach out to my [email](mailto:contact@dylan-maclean.com)!
