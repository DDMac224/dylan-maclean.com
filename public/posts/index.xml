      <description>Intro I have been watching some hardware hacking videos on YouTube recently and wanted to try for it myself. I found two old routers labeled &amp;ldquo;Orbi.&amp;rdquo; After looking them up, I found that one is the router and the other is called the &amp;ldquo;satellite&amp;rdquo; which to my understanding is just another access point. Neither of them were in use, They also hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in a while which made them perfect to try hardware hacking for the first time.</description>
