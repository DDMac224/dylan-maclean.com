        <h1>Orbi Hacking</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content__body">
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I have been watching some hardware hacking videos on YouTube recently and wanted to try for it myself. I found two old routers labeled &ldquo;Orbi.&rdquo; After looking them up, I found that one is the router and the other is called the &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; which to my understanding is just another access point. Neither of them were in use, They also hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a while which made them perfect to try hardware hacking for the first time. My main goal was to dump the firmware and look through it at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="system-details">System Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Device name: <code>Netgear Orbi RBR50</code></li>
<li>RAM: <code>512MB</code></li>
<li>eMMC storage: <code>4GB</code></li>
<li>Architecture: <code>armv7l</code></li>
<li>Firmware version: <code>V2.3.5.30</code></li>
<li>Kernel: <code>Linux RBR50 3.14.77 #1 SMP PREEMPT</code></li>
<li>U-Boot version: <code>V2012.07</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uart">UART</h2>
<p>I took the board out of the plastic case but left the heat sinks on it, because I might put OpenWRT on it. I don&rsquo;t want to have to reapply thermal paste later on if I can avoid it.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pcb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I noticed four pins on the left side of the board that i assumed to be UART.</p>
<p><img src="./img/uart.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I used a multimeter to check for continuity between the antenna and each pin, I found that the right most pin was continuous, meaning that it was ground. After finding ground, I turned my multimeter to voltage mode and tested each pin from left to right while booting up the router. The left most pin had a constant 3.3V to ground, meaning it was the VCC pin since it was supplying power. The second to the left most pin had a fluctuating voltage to ground, meaning it was the TXD pin because it was sending out data. The second to the right most pin had a  voltage of 0 to ground, meaning it was the RXD pin because nothing was being transmitted through it. This gave me the pinout of:</p>

<h2 id="root-shell">Root Shell</h2>
<p>I hooked up my UART to USB bridge with the pins and launched <a href="https://github.com/npat-efault/picocom">picocom</a> with the guess baud rate of 115200.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
</code></pre><p>I hit the power button and got a wall of text of boot messages from U-Boot and the kernel. I noticed the root password getting changed in the wall of text, that is something I will look into later.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Changing password for root
[KC] RBS50 IPP v1.5 Start (Jun  6 2017 17:15:40)
New password: 
Password for root changed by root
Changing password for admin
New password: traffic_meter start : .
</code></pre><p>I waited for the router to finish booting and was dropped into an unrestricted root shell.</p>
<h2 id="firmware-extraction">Firmware Extraction</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to run mount to check what parts of the file system were writeable and executable.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root@RBS50:/# mount
rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)
/dev/root on /rom type squashfs (ro,relatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime)
overlayfs:/tmp/overlay on / type overlayfs (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/,upperdir=/tmp/overlay)
tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,relatime,size=512k,mode=755)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,mode=600)
debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,noatime)
/dev/mmcblk0p27 on /tmp/device_tables type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
</code></pre><p>Seeing that <code>/tmp</code> was writeable and executable it worked as a good place to download  an <a href="https://github.com/therealsaumil/static-arm-bins">arm binary of dd</a> to use for firmware extraction.</p>

</code></pre><p>From here I needed some way to take the firmware off the device. Luckily the router has a USB port. I formatted a spare USB thumb drive to FAT32 to avoid any possible compatibility issues, then plugged it into the router. The router automatically mounted the USB drive to <code>tmp/mnt/sda1</code>. Now that I had a place to put the firmware, I checked for block devices in <code>/dev</code>.</p>

</code></pre><p>Knowing the size of the chip on the device is 4GB; it was clear that <code>mmcblk0</code> was the entire device&rsquo;s storage. At that point, all I had to do was use dd to copy the block device to my USB drive.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Orbi was quite insecure on the hardware level which made it a great first target to try hardware hacking. I was easily able to extract the entire storage simply by getting into the UART shell. Later on, I&rsquo;m going to do an in-depth exploration of the firmware image since there were definitely some interesting things i could see at first glance as well as in the boot messages.</p>
